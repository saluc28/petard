## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `analyze-opa`, which reads an OPA bundle in either Rego syntax and reports what its decisions
  depend on: every read of `data` with the reference, the file and the line, who chooses the
  document each read lands on, the values the policy did not compute, and the shape of the
  request with the level it was recognized at. Given concrete data it evaluates each decision
  partially and reports what is left of it.
- The taxonomy registry, eight patterns as versioned data under `taxonomy-registry/`, each with
  the conditions under which it stays quiet and the cases it has been held to. Two of them end
  in a `PTD_CanEscalateTo` edge between two principals.
- The write model, which declares who can write which path, since no policy says it. Without one
  every match stays a candidate, and the run reports how much of what the decisions read the
  model covers.
- `export-opengraph`, which sends the same analysis to BloodHound CE as a structured OpenGraph:
  it installs the extension schema and the saved queries, uploads the payload, and with
  `-verify` asks the server to walk every escalation the payload declares. `-prune-queries`
  removes saved queries a rename left behind.
- The extension definition schema in `schema/petard.json`, generated from the model, with five
  node kinds, five relationship kinds, and what BloodHound shows in the Entity Panel for each.
- 29 saved Cypher queries under `queries/`, two to four per pattern, in the format of the
  BloodHound Query Library.
- `measure-corpus`, which runs the engine over a body of Rego written by somebody else.
